            <p>Gordon Moore is the scientific brain behind Intel, the world&rsquo;s biggest maker of computer chips. Both funny and self-deprecating, he&rsquo;s a shrewd businessman too, but admits to being an &lsquo;accidental entrepreneur&rsquo;, happier in the back room trading ideas with techies than out selling the product or chatting up the stockholders. When he applied for a job at Dow Chemical after gaining his PhD, the company psychologist ruled that 1 was okay technically, but that I&rsquo;d never manage anything&rsquo;. This year Intel is set to turn over $28 billion.</p>
<p><span class="explainq39 explain">When Moore co-founded Intel (short for Integrated Electronics) to develop integrated circuits thirty-five years ago, <span class="explainq27">he provided the motive force in R&amp;D (Research &amp; Development)</span> while his more extrovert partner Robert&nbsp;Noyce&nbsp;became the public face of the company.</span> Intel&rsquo;s ethos was distinctively Californian: laid- back, democratic, polo shirt and chinos. Moore worked in a cubicle like everyone else, never had a designated parking space and flew Economy. <span class="explainq28 explain">None of this implied lack of ambition. Moore and&nbsp;Noyce&nbsp;shared a vision, recognising that success depended just as much on intellectual&nbsp;pizazz&nbsp;as on Intel&rsquo;s ability to deliver a product.&nbsp;</span>Noyce&nbsp;himself received the first patent for an integrated circuit in 1961, while both partners were learning the business of electronics at Fair child Semiconductor.</p>
<p><span class="explainq29 explain">Fair child&rsquo;s success put money in Moore and&nbsp;Noyce&rsquo;s&nbsp;pockets, but they were starved of R&amp;D money.</span> They resigned, frustrated, to found Intel in 1968. &lsquo;It was one of those rare periods when money was available,&rsquo; says Moore. They put in $250,000 each and drummed up another $2.5m of venture capital &lsquo;on the strength of a one-page business plan that said essentially nothing&rsquo;. Ownership was divided 50:50 between founders and backers. <span class="explainq30 explain">Three years later, Intel&rsquo;s first microprocessor was released: the 4004, carrying 2,250 transistors. Progress after that was rapid. By the time the competition realised what was happening, Intel had amassed a seven-year R&amp;D lead that it was never to relinquish.</span></p>
<p>By the year 2000, Intel&rsquo;s Pentium-4 chip was carrying 42 million transistors. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; says Moore, &lsquo;we put a quarter of a billion transistors on a chip and are looking forward to a billion in the near future.&rsquo; The performance gains have been phenomenal. The 4004 ran at 108 kilohertz (108,000 hertz), the Pentium*4 at three gigahertz (3 billion hertz). It&rsquo;s calculated that if automobile speed had increased similarly over the same period, you could now drive from New York to San Francisco in six seconds.</p>
<p><span class="explainq31 explain">Moore&rsquo;s prescience in forecasting this revolution is legendary. In 1965, while still head of the R&amp;D laboratory at Fair child, <span class="explainq35 explain">he wrote a piece for Electronics magazine observing &lsquo;that over the first few years we had essentially doubled the complexity of integrated circuits every year.</span></span> I blindly extrapolated for the next ten years and said we&rsquo;d go from about 60 to about 60,000 transistors on a chip.<span class="explainq36 explain"> It proved a much more spot-on prediction than I could ever have imagined</span>, up until then, <span class="explainq38 explain"><span class="explainq37">integrated circuits had been expensive </span>and had had principally military applications</span>. But I could see that the economics were going to switch dramatically. <span class="explainq40 explain">This was going to become the cheapest way to make electronics.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>The prediction that a chip&rsquo;s transistor-count &ndash; and thus its performance &ndash; would keep doubling every year soon proved so accurate that Carver Mead, a friend from&nbsp;Caltech, dubbed it &lsquo;Moore&rsquo;s Law&rsquo;. The name has stuck. &lsquo;Moore&rsquo;s Law&rsquo; has become the yardstick by which the exponential growth of the computer industry has been measured ever since. <span class="explainq32 explain">When, in 1975, Moore looked around him again and saw transistor-counts slowing, he predicted that in future chip-performance would double only every two years. But that proved pessimistic.</span> Actual growth since then has split the difference between his two predictions, with performance doubling every 1 8 months.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a corollary, <span class="explainq33 explain">says Moore. &lsquo;If the cost of a given amount of computer power drops 50 per cent every 1 8 months, each time that happens the market explodes with new applications that hadn&rsquo;t been economical before.&rsquo;</span> He sees the microprocessor as &lsquo;almost infinitely elastic&rsquo;. As prices fall, new applications keep emerging: smart light bulbs, flashing trainers or greetings cards that sing &lsquo;Happy Birthday&rsquo;. Where will it all stop? Well, it&rsquo;s true, he says, &lsquo;that in a few more generations [of chips], the fact that materials are made of atoms starts to be a real problem. Essentially, you can&rsquo;t make things any smaller.&rsquo; But in practice, the day of reckoning is endlessly postponed as engineers find endlessly more ingenious ways of loading more transistors on a chip. &lsquo;<span class="explainq34 explain">I suspect I shared the feelings of everybody else that when we got to the dimensions of a micron [about 1986Ị, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to continue because we were touching the wavelength of light. But as we got closer, the barriers just melted away,&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>When conventional chips finally reach their limits, nanotechnology beckons. Researchers are already working on&nbsp;sci-fi sounding alternatives such as molecular computers, built atom by atom, that theoretically could process hundreds of thousands times more information than today&rsquo;s processors. Quantum computers using the state of electrons as the basis for calculation could operate still faster. On any measure, there looks to be plenty of life left in Moore&rsquo;s Law yet.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>A</b> <input type='radio' id ='q3' value='A' onclick='grd(this)' disabled ></input> It was primarily motivated by the existence of funds that made it possible.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>B</b> <input type='radio' id ='q3' value='B' onclick='grd(this)' disabled ></input> It involved keeping certain sensitive information secret.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>C</b> <input type='radio' id ='q3' value='C' onclick='grd(this)' disabled ></input> It resulted from the founders&rsquo; desire to launch a particular product.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>D</b> <input type='radio' id ='q3' value='D' onclick='grd(this)' disabled ></input> It was caused by the founders&rsquo; dissatisfaction with their employer&rsquo;s priorities.&nbsp;<br/><span class="answer">Answer: D</span></p>

<p>Gordon Moore&rsquo;s ability to foresee developments is well-known. In 1965, he referred to the increase in the <b>9 </b><input type='text' required id='q9' onkeyup='gtb(this)' readonly value="" > <br/><span class="answer">Answer: sophistication</span> of integrated circuits and guessed that the number of transistors would go on rising for a decade. The <b>10 </b><input type='text' required id='q10' onkeyup='gtb(this)' readonly value="" >&nbsp;<br/><span class="answer">Answer: accuracy</span> of his prediction surprised him. Previously, the <b>11 </b><input type='text' required id='q11' onkeyup='gtb(this)' readonly value="" >&nbsp;<br/><span class="answer">Answer: cost</span> and main <b>12 </b><input type='text' required id='q12' onkeyup='gtb(this)' readonly value="" >&nbsp;<br/><span class="answer">Answer: use</span> of integrated circuits had been the major <b>13 </b><input type='text' required id='q13' onkeyup='gtb(this)' readonly value="" >&nbsp;<br/><span class="answer">Answer: influence</span> with regard to their development. But Moore observed that the <b>14 </b><input type='text' required id='q14' onkeyup='gtb(this)' readonly value="" > <br/><span class="answer">Answer: cost-effectiveness</span> of integrated circuits was going to improve dramatically. His resulting forecasts concerning chips led to the creation of the term &lsquo;Moore&rsquo;s Law&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
